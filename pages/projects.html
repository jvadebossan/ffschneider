              Prior to the development of this device, the Brazilian veterinary
              market faced a significant gap: the lack of a cost-effective,
              purpose-built solution tailored specifically for veterinarians
              that needed a portable anesthesia and ventilatory device.

              This project introduced me to new areas such as customer-centric
