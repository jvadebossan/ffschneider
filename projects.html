              Prior to the development of this device, the Brazilian veterinary
              market faced a significant gap: the lack of a cost-effective,
              purpose-built solution tailored specifically for veterinarians
              that needed a portable anesthesia and ventilatory device.
            </p>
            <p class="project_desc">
              This project introduced me to new areas such as customer-centric
              design, user interviews, field performance evaluations (that's me
              in the picture), and direct collaboration with the client.
            </p>
            <p class="project_desc">
              The result was a functional, user-friendly device that remains
              affordable for the majority of veterinarians, addressing a
              critical need in the market.
